Hi r/JujutsuShenanigans :)

once im actually happy with this ill make a release as an exe for yall

feel free to help out with this btw if you have any ideas

to explain sukuna: when you press g as yuji the timer will swap to a 13.5s cd instead of 2s, you can press g again when the ult ends to swap back. i do this so people who play other things like inf ult games dont have to deal with a timer based swap thing.
